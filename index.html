                        Making music isn't easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. 
                        But when you're in the flow, it's incredibly rewarding.

                        We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is our

                    backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in 
                    between. What connects us is the shared belief that each of us has the skills 
                    and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.
